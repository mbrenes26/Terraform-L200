# k8sLabs
This mind map provides an overview of the key components in your lab setup. 
It starts with the "Lab Setup" section, which encompasses all the different aspects of your lab. 
The "Infrastructure as Code (IaC)" section emphasizes the importance of managing your lab infrastructure using code, enabling reproducibility and scalability..

The "Azure Resources" section represents the various cloud resources you'll be provisioning within Azure. This includes virtual machines running Ubuntu as the operating system. 
The "Kubernetes Cluster Setup" section focuses on setting up and configuring Kubernetes within your virtual machines.

The "Tools and Technologies" section highlights the key tools and technologies you'll be using, such as VS Code as your integrated development environment (IDE), Terraform for infrastructure provisioning and management, and GitHub CI/CD for continuous integration and deployment.

Lastly, the "Lab Objectives" and "Lab Components" sections define the specific objectives you want to achieve in your lab and outline the individual components you'll be working with, including Docker and containers for containerization, and a WordPress site that will be containerized using Docker and deployed to Kubernetes.

1. Lab Setup  
    1.1 Infrastructure as Code (IaC)  

      1.1.1 Azure Resources

      1.1.2 Virtual machines (Ubuntu OS)

      1.1.3 Kubernetes Cluster Setup

2. Tools and Technologies  

   2.1 Lab Objectives

   2.1.1 **Provision an Azure environment:** Set up an Azure subscription and create the necessary resources, such as virtual machines, networking, and storage, using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform.

   2.1.2 **Configure Kubernetes cluster:** Deploy and configure a Kubernetes cluster on the Ubuntu virtual machines in Azure, ensuring proper networking, security, and scalability.

   2.1.3 **Practice using VS Code:** Utilize VS Code as the primary Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write, edit, and debug code, with a focus on Kubernetes-related configurations and scripts.

   2.1.4 **Implement CI/CD with GitHub:** Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or other suitable tools to automate the build, test, and deployment processes for your Kubernetes application.

   2.1.5 **Containerize a WordPress site:** Dockerize a WordPress site by creating Docker images for both the WordPress application and its dependencies. Use Docker Compose to define and manage the containers.

   2.1.6 **Deploy WordPress to Kubernetes:** Deploy the containerized WordPress application to the Kubernetes cluster, leveraging Kubernetes resources like Pods, Services, and Ingress to ensure high availability and scalability.
