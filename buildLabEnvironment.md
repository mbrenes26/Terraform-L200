# buildLabEnvorinment

In this project centered around Terraform, you're going to use VS Code and deploy an
Azure Linux machine along with virtual network, subnet, security groups, etc. that will serve as
a remote development environment that you can log into directly from VS Code. We'll utilize
several Terraform tools and functions such as Terraform State, Format, Replace, Console,
Variables, Conditionals, and more. We'll also use Azure custom data and a provisioner to bootstrap
the virtual machine with Docker and add its connection information to your VS Code SSH
configuration file, allowing you to modify it for your own projects. Since we'll make heavy use of
documentation and highlight the process behind developing a brand new Terraform deployment,
you'll have the skills you need to dive deeper into Terraform and add this extremely in-demand
skill. Now We're going to open a new project in VS Code

## VSCode Setup
Install the Azure CLI, connect to our Azure account, and install a Terraform extension.
